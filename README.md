Steps I need to take
Figure out what variables I want
Grab them from each data set
Make sure each variable is in the same order 
Rbind them

Variables: 
FollowUpTimePoint, AvatarClient_ID, all health capital scale items, generate a state ID location indicator



Load data.  Just get the actual data for now don't worry about sub group analyses.  
Add a state ID variable so we can differential them later on
```{r}
setwd("T:/Clinical Model Materials/Clinical Models/Adult Health Home/Evaluation Materials/Data/1. Health Capital Scale/6. October 2018/Matt'sData")
CIL_South_HCS_10052018 = read.csv("CIL_South_HCS_10052018.csv", header = TRUE)
CIL_West_HCS_10052018 = read.csv("CIL_West_HCS_10052018.csv", header = TRUE)
CKY_HCS_10052018 = read.csv("CKY_HCS_10052018.csv", header = TRUE)

head(CIL_South_HCS_10052018)

CIL_South_HCS = CIL_South_HCS_10052018[c("AvatarClient_ID", "FollowUpTimePoint", "GoodHealth",	"ManageHealthProblems",	"KnowHealthConditions",	"PhysicalActivity",	"ManageMentalWellness",	"HopesForFuture",	"NotOverwhelmed",	"Attending_PCP",	"ProvidersSimilarGoals",	"CommunicateHealthcareNeeds",	"NoFutureHospitalization",	"No_ED_Use",	"KnowPrescribedMeds",	"TakePrescribedMeds",	"NoSideEffectsConcerns", "CookNutritiousMeals",	"NutritiousFoodPhysicalBarrier",	"NutritiousFoodFinancialBarrier",	"NutritiousWellBalanced",	"HealthyHomeEnvironment",	"SafeMovingAroundHome",	"LivingSituationSatisfaction",	"HaveHome", "PhysicallySafeNeighborhood",	"LiveCloseLovedOnes",	"TransportationAccess",	"SupportiveFriends",	"ParticipateSocialActivity",	"DifficultHealthWellness", "ProvideFinancialSupportFamily",	"ManageFinances",	"FinancialNegativeAffectHealth",	"EducationSatisfaction",	"EmploymentSatisfaction")]
StateID = rep(0, dim(CIL_South_HCS)[1])
CIL_South_HCS = data.frame(StateID, CIL_South_HCS)


CIL_West_HCS = CIL_West_HCS_10052018[c("AvatarClient_ID", "FollowUpTimePoint", "GoodHealth",	"ManageHealthProblems",	"KnowHealthConditions",	"PhysicalActivity",	"ManageMentalWellness",	"HopesForFuture",	"NotOverwhelmed",	"Attending_PCP",	"ProvidersSimilarGoals",	"CommunicateHealthcareNeeds",	"NoFutureHospitalization",	"No_ED_Use",	"KnowPrescribedMeds",	"TakePrescribedMeds",	"NoSideEffectsConcerns", "CookNutritiousMeals",	"NutritiousFoodPhysicalBarrier",	"NutritiousFoodFinancialBarrier",	"NutritiousWellBalanced",	"HealthyHomeEnvironment",	"SafeMovingAroundHome",	"LivingSituationSatisfaction",	"HaveHome", "PhysicallySafeNeighborhood",	"LiveCloseLovedOnes",	"TransportationAccess",	"SupportiveFriends",	"ParticipateSocialActivity",	"DifficultHealthWellness", "ProvideFinancialSupportFamily",	"ManageFinances",	"FinancialNegativeAffectHealth",	"EducationSatisfaction",	"EmploymentSatisfaction")]
StateID = rep(1, dim(CIL_West_HCS)[1])
CIL_West_HCS = data.frame(StateID, CIL_West_HCS)



head(CKY_HCS_10052018)
CKY_HCS = CKY_HCS_10052018[c("AvatarClient_ID", "FollowUpTimePoint", "GoodHealth",	"ManageHealthProblems",	"KnowHealthConditions",	"PhysicalActivity",	"ManageMentalWellness",	"HopesForFuture",	"NotOverwhelmed",	"Attending_PCP",	"ProvidersSimilarGoals",	"CommunicateHealthcareNeeds",	"NoFutureHospitalization",	"No_ED_Use",	"KnowPrescribedMeds",	"TakePrescribedMeds",	"NoSideEffectsConcerns", "CookNutritiousMeals",	"NutritiousFoodPhysicalBarrier",	"NutritiousFoodFinancialBarrier",	"NutritiousWellBalanced",	"HealthyHomeEnvironment",	"SafeMovingAroundHome",	"LivingSituationSatisfaction",	"HaveHome", "PhysicallySafeNeighborhood",	"LiveCloseLovedOnes",	"TransportationAccess",	"SupportiveFriends",	"ParticipateSocialActivity",	"DifficultHealthWellness", "ProvideFinancialSupportFamily",	"ManageFinances",	"FinancialNegativeAffectHealth",	"EducationSatisfaction",	"EmploymentSatisfaction")]
StateID = rep(2, dim(CKY_HCS)[1])
CKY_HCS = data.frame(StateID, CKY_HCS)

HCS = rbind(CIL_South_HCS, CIL_West_HCS, CKY_HCS)

```
Now we need to clean the data
First see how much missing data there is an delete where 70% or greater is missing
Losing about half the data set here with just getting rid of NAs
We want to keep the 1's, because those are the values with less 70% missing data
Starting N = 2654
Ending N = 1586
```{r}
dim(HCS)
HCSNas = data.frame(is.na(HCS))
head(HCSNas)
HCSNas$NAs = apply(HCSNas, 1, sum)
HCSNas$Nas = HCSNas$NAs / dim(HCSNas)[2]
describe.factor(HCSNas$Nas)
HCS$NAs = ifelse(HCSNas$Nas >=.7, 0,1)

HCS = subset(HCS, NAs == 1)
HCS$NAs = NULL
dim(HCS)

```

####################
I cannot tell if the blanks for time are unique people or for what time point they are at so they must be deleted
######################

Need a unique number of people so only intake and then check duplicate
N = 216

Ok get the || out now need to get the first "1" out

Now we need to get rid of the NA's for ID 
N = 41 with people only actual Avatar IDs
```{r}
HCS = subset(HCS, FollowUpTimePoint == "Intake")
names(HCS)[2] = "AvatarID"
dim(HCS)
head(HCS$AvatarID)

HCS$AvatarID = gsub("\\D", "", HCS$AvatarID)
head(HCS$AvatarID)
# Start from the second character
HCS$AvatarID = substring(HCS$AvatarID, 2)
head(HCS$AvatarID)
write.csv(HCS, "HCS.csv", row.names = FALSE)
HCS = read.csv("HCS.csv", header = TRUE, na.strings = "")

HCS = subset(HCSTest, AvatarID > 0)
sum(is.na((HCSTest$AvatarID)))
dim(HCS)
```
Now try to merge with Passport data
HCS_Passport
```{r}
HCS_Passport = merge(HCS, InfoMC10_PassPort_10_18, by = "AvatarID",all.x = TRUE)
dim(HCS_Passport)
HCS_Passport = na.omit(HCS_Passport)
```
